# Weather-App
The goal of this project is to develop a responsive and user-friendly weather app that provides real-time weather updates, a 5-day forecast, air quality index, sunrise & sunset timings, and additional weather metrics based on user input or geolocation, using a weather API.

The development of the Weather App follows a structured process, starting with project planning and requirement analysis, where core features like real-time weather updates, forecasts, and air quality index (AQI) are defined. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. Next, API integration is implemented to fetch weather data from a reliable source, allowing users to search for cities or use geolocation for automatic weather retrieval. Key features such as current weather details, a 5-day forecast, hourly updates, AQI, and sunrise/sunset timings are added to enhance user experience. The app undergoes testing and debugging to ensure accurate data retrieval, smooth performance, and mobile compatibility. Once stable, it is deployed on a hosting platform like GitHub Pages followed by performance optimizations to reduce API calls and improve efficiency. Finally, maintenance and future enhancements are planned, including new features like dark mode, weather alerts, or improved UI elements based on user feedback.

The Weather App provides real-time weather updates, a 5-day forecast, and hourly temperature trends. It includes features like air quality index (AQI), sunrise and sunset timings, and detailed weather metrics such as humidity, wind speed, and "feels like" temperature. The app is user-friendly, responsive, and supports geolocation for automatic weather retrieval. Future enhancements may include dark mode, weather alerts, and more customization options.
